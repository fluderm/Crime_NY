    "text": "1 Introduction\n\nIn the process of deciding on a topic for our project, we received several emails from the Columbia department of Safety about an armed robbery near Columbia campus. This prompted us to get interested in Crime data in and around NYC. We found several very interesting datasets pertaining to crime in NYC and NY State and decided on focusing first and foremost on NY State. This is an interesting topic due to its insights into crime trends over time and across different areas.\n\nThe first chosen dataset allows us to analyze the evolution of crime over the past 33 years per NY county but also to compare the crime statistics between NYC and NY state. We can explore questions related to crime rates, patterns, and potential influencing factors. For instance, one might investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors, law enforcement strategies, or demographic changes on crime rates. Another interesting question could be the effect of covid on the crime statistics. This dataset allows for a comprehensive analysis of public safety trends, aiding policymakers and the public in understanding and addressing crime issues.\n\n\nCode\n#https://data.ny.gov/Government-Finance/Annual-Population-Estimates-for-New-York-State-and/krt9-ym2k"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nTo answer research questions related to crime trends and influencing factors, the first dataset offers a rich source of information. Regarding the temporal analysis, we can examine crime rates over multiple years and then can identify trends and patterns. This enables the assessment of whether crime has increased, decreased, or remained stable over time, providing insights into the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies, changes in societal conditions or from the perspective of pre/during/post covid. Moreover, a geographic analysis is also possible. Indeed, the dataset includes information on crimes reported by different counties and agencies. This allows us to compare crime rates across regions, potentially revealing spatial patterns. For example, we can compare the evolution of crime between NYC and NY state. Understanding variations in crime rates helps tailor interventions to specific areas. The dataset is categorized into specific crime types. So, we can analyze trends in each category individually, helping to identify areas of concern and inform targeted interventions. Furthermore, additional demographic information, if available, could be integrated into the analysis. This might involve exploring correlations between crime rates and socioeconomic factors, population density, or demographic shifts over time. We can also assess the impact of law enforcement strategies by analyzing changes in crime rates following the implementation of specific policies or practices. Since the dataset spans several years, we can conduct longitudinal studies, observing changes and trends over extended periods. This can provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing crime dynamics. By comparing data across different agencies or counties, researchers can identify variations in reporting practices, law enforcement effectiveness, or community characteristics that may influence crime rates. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential limitations such as data inconsistencies, reporting biases, and missing information, which may affect the robustness of conclusions drawn from the analysis."
