# Data

The dataset on Index Crimes by County and Agency in New York , https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Index-Crimes-by-County-and-Agency-Beginning-1990/ca8h-8gjq , is collected by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services which obtains crime reports from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs' departments. 
The data is formatted in a tabular structure, with columns specifying details like county, agency, year, region, and various crime categories. So, the dataset includes geographic information (county and agency), temporal information (year), and crime categories. 
The reporting system gathers data on seven Index offenses, which are commonly utilized to assess the overall volume of crime. These encompass violent crimes such as murder/non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, as well as property crimes like burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.
The dimensions of the data are of 22K rows and 15 columns.
The data has been collected since January 1990. The frequency of updates is on an annual basis, but the individual law enforcement agencies monthly report their total crimes to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services.
Possible issues with the data could include inconsistencies in reporting methods among different agencies, variations in the definition of crimes, or potential underreporting. We should be cautious about these nuances when interpreting trends or making comparisons across regions and time periods. Indeed, police agencies might encounter challenges in reporting, which could hinder accurate or comprehensive data submission. The figures reflect solely the crimes reported to the police and do not encompass the total number of crimes that took place.


## Description

To answer research questions related to crime trends and influencing factors, the first dataset offers a rich source of information. Regarding the temporal analysis, we can examine crime rates over multiple years and then can identify trends and patterns. This enables the assessment of whether crime has increased, decreased, or remained stable over time, providing insights into the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies, changes in societal conditions or from the perspective of pre/during/post covid.
Moreover, a geographic analysis is also possible. Indeed, the dataset includes information on crimes reported by different counties and agencies. This allows us to compare crime rates across regions, potentially revealing spatial patterns. For example, we can compare the evolution of crime between NYC and NY state. Understanding variations in crime rates helps tailor interventions to specific areas. 
The dataset is categorized into specific crime types. So, we can analyze trends in each category individually, helping to identify areas of concern and inform targeted interventions. 
Furthermore, additional demographic information, if available, could be integrated into the analysis. This might involve exploring correlations between crime rates and socioeconomic factors, population density, or demographic shifts over time. 
We can also assess the impact of law enforcement strategies by analyzing changes in crime rates following the implementation of specific policies or practices.
Since the dataset spans several years, we can conduct longitudinal studies, observing changes and trends over extended periods. This can provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing crime dynamics. 
By comparing data across different agencies or counties, researchers can identify variations in reporting practices, law enforcement effectiveness, or community characteristics that may influence crime rates. 
However, it's crucial to acknowledge potential limitations such as data inconsistencies, reporting biases, and missing information, which may affect the robustness of conclusions drawn from the analysis.
