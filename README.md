# Crime in NY State

This repository contains the final project for EDAV 2023. In this project, we investigate crime trends and crime statistics in New York State based on the primary dataset [Index Crimes by County and Agency in New York](https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Index-Crimes-by-County-and-Agency-Beginning-1990/ca8h-8gjq) and supplementary data.

We investigate various interesting questions from a EDAV point of view, such as:

 - Overall trends of crime in NY State in the past 30 years.
 - Effect of COVID-19 on crimes in NY State and specifically different Counties.
 - Effects of specific crime-fighting statistics, focusing on the example of stop-and-frisk in NYC.
 - Correlations among NY State counties and crime types/rates and potential demographics.
